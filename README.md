# Frontend Bootcamp

## Welcome

In this two-part workshop you'll learn the basics of frontend development while building a working web app.

The first part will introduce you to the fundamentals of frontend web development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

The second part will dive into more advanced topics like TypeScript, state management, testing, and Redux.

## Getting set up

### 1. Installing and opening the project

- Open your terminal and use the `cd` (change directory) command to find an appropriate place for your code (for example, type `mkdir react-projects` followed by `cd react-projects` to create and go to a new empty folder dedicated to React development)
- Type `git clone https://github.com/wiljwang/frontend-bootcamp.git` into the terminal to pull down a copy of the workshop code
- Type `cd frontend-bootcamp` to change your current directory to the bootcamp folder
- Type `yarn` to install all of the project dependencies
- Type `code .` to open the bootcamp code in VS Code
  > If you're on a Mac, make sure you've followed [these steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line) first to make the `code` command available.

### 2. Run the "inner loop" build

At this point, your VS Code window should look something like this:

To start the dev "inner loop," run:

```
yarn start
```

This will load the site shown below.
