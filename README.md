# Frontend Bootcamp

## Welcome

In this two-part workshop you'll learn the basics of frontend development while building a working web app.

The first part will introduce you to the fundamentals of frontend web development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

The second part will dive into more advanced topics like TypeScript, state management, testing, and Redux.

## Getting set up

### 1. Installing and opening the project

- Open VS Code and then press `` ctrl + ` `` (backtick, in top left corner of keyboard) to open the built-in terminal
- Use the `cd` (change directory) command to find an appropriate place for your code
- Type `git clone https://github.com/wiljwang/frontend-bootcamp.git` into the terminal to pull down a copy of the workshop code
- Type `cd frontend-bootcamp` to change your current directory to the bootcamp folder
- Type `npm install` to install all of the project dependencies
- Type `code -r .` to open the bootcamp code in VS Code
  > If on a Mac, be sure you've followed [these steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line) first to make the `code` command available.

### 2. Run the "inner loop" build

At this point, your VS Code window should look something like this:

### 3. Lesson Structure

1. Demos are done via CodePen (Steps 1, 2 and 3) or done in the step folder. Follow the steps in README.md to walk through the demo.

2. Exercises are done via CodePen or in the step folder. They will give you an opportunity to try what was demonstrated in the demo.
